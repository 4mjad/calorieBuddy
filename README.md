R8C: Implement a delete button to delete the whole record, when the delete button is pressed, it is good practice to ask 'Are you sure?' and then delete the food item from the database, and display a message indicating the delete has been done. You can go beyond this requirement by letting ONLY the user who created the same food item delete it.
